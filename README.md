# My first Angular project
> This is my first Angular project. It's like a test. 

I want to learn Angular8 during this project.
I try to just use Angular official documents. https://angular.io/start


## clone
```
git clone https://github.com/mortezaataiy/my-first-angular-project.git
```
## install
```
npm install && cd client && npm install
```
Import `basic_db_to_test_angular8.sql` in MySQL and set config file.
## start
```
// run server:
npm run server

// run client (angular)
npm run client

// or
cd client && ng serve --open

// run server and client
npm run dev
```
You can use Postman and import `my-first-angular-project.postman_collection.json` to test back-end.
